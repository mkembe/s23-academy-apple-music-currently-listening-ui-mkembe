UI Design for Apple Music Currently Listening View

Description:

This view shows you what song you are listening to and gives various options for playing, pausing, skipping, etc. 

The app is for IOS users

The app was built using XCode

In the future, I want to complete the design by implementing button functionality and animating the song title to wrap around the screen, similar to how it works in Apple Music. 

Features:

- Album Cover 
- Settings Button
- Previous, Play/Pause, Skip Buttons
- Time Slider
- Lyrics Button
- Song Queue Button
- Airplay Button w/ External Audio Device Name Displayed
